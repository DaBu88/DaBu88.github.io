            <p>The organic food movement grew out of the seeds of thought that action needed to be taken to save the environment and protect our children from the overuse of toxic chemicals.  Organic farming was spurred on by the "Back to the Land" movement.  The belief was that to be living simply and using sustainable farming techniques would be better for people and the planet and create a safe and reliable food supply for the future.</p>
            <p>In the early 1970s, Axis Natural Foods was a Maine pioneer in the organic farming movement and the purveying of natural products.  Axis Natural Foods was a vital part of the vibrant downtown Lewiston/Auburn community.  We will continue to be dedicated to serving the State of Maine and beyond with room to grow at our new location at 120 Center Street Plaza in Auburn, Maine.</p>
